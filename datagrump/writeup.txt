Exercise 1: The best single window size to maximize the score was a window size of 13, and a average power score of 12.83. The stddev of our measurements was ~.05 for 12,13 and 14


Exercise 2:
We implemented AIMD with parameters
window := window + a
window := window x b
for values 
a = 1/ window, 1/(2*window)
b = 1/8, 1/4, 1/2

These schemes produced results much
lower than a fixed window size. Our best result 
was for a = 1/ (2*window), b = 1/4

Exercise 3:
We implemented a delay based congestion, initially with AIMD triggered by delay over/under a constant value of 100, 150, and 300ms.

We then modified the addition and recovery mechanisms and got much higher power scores.
